Detect when players have traded with a villager, without the use of Paper server software. (Spigot)
Spigot: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/villagertradeevent.104298/

If you are on Maven, you can add the JitPack repository:
```xml
	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
```

Otherwise, if you are using Gradle, you can add the JitPack repository:
```xml
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
```
